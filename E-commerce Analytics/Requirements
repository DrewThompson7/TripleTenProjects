E-commerce Project Requirements Breakdown

This project involves analyzing user activity data to understand website conversion and user retention for an e-commerce company. Here's a breakdown of the requirements by part:

Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel

Use "raw_user_activity" data to create a conversion funnel (new sheet named "conversion_funnel") using a pivot table.
Count unique users for each stage of the funnel (3 stages).
Create formulas in the pivot table for:
Total conversion rates
Conversion rates to the next step (refer to "Overview of Funnels" lesson)
Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis

Filter Purchases:
Focus only on purchase events from "raw_user_activity".
Create a new sheet "purchase_activity" and copy only purchase data from the filtered "raw_user_activity".
Ensure there are 4,845 rows (including headers) in the new sheet.
Reset the filter in "raw_user_activity".
Calculate First Purchase Dates:
Create a new sheet "first_purchase" using a pivot table from "purchase_activity" data.
Calculate the minimum event_date for each user (represents first purchase date).
Use VLOOKUP in "purchase_activity" sheet (column G) to find the first purchase date for each user ID from the "first_purchase" sheet.
Set Up Monthly Data:
Create new columns in "purchase_activity": event_month, first_purchase_month, cohort_age.
Use TEXT function to create event_month and first_purchase_month in YYYY-MM format.
Use DATEDIF function to create cohort_age (number of months between first purchase and event).
Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates

Group Data into Cohorts:
Create a new sheet "cohort_analysis" using a pivot table from "purchase_activity" data.
Configure the pivot table to show cohorts based on the month of first purchase (6 cohorts expected).
The pivot table should also have the count of unique users for each cohort age in the columns.
Calculate Overall Retention Rates:
Create a new sheet "retention_rates".
Add row labels for each cohort (A3:A7) matching "cohort_analysis".
Add column labels for cohort ages (B2:E2) from 1 to 4 months.
Create a formula in cell B3 (and copy to other cells) to calculate retention rates for each cohort age based on starting cohort sizes.
Part 4: Organize and Document Your Spreadsheet

Executive Summary:
Briefly summarize results from "conversion_funnel" and "retention_rates" sheets.
Explain data properties, assumptions used in analysis (data source, timeframe, calculation methods).
Reorder Sheets:
Organize sheets according to the provided legend:
Table of Contents & Executive Summary
Analytical Results Sheets
Calculation Sheets
Raw Data Sheets
Update the "Table of Contents" with sheet names and descriptions.
Formatting:
Apply formatting for readability (number/date formats, borders, bold headers, frozen rows, highlight calculation cells).
