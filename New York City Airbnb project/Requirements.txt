Project Requirements Breakdown

This project involves analyzing an Airbnb dataset from NYC to help a client decide on a vacation rental property investment. Here's a breakdown of the requirements by section:

Part 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning

Familiarize yourself with the data by reviewing each sheet (listings, calendar, data_dictionary).
Identify relevant columns for analysis (e.g., neighborhood, price, number of reviews).
Prepare a separate sheet to document data cleaning steps.
Organize the spreadsheet for easier navigation (freezing rows/columns, resizing widths, adding filters).
Filter listings based on relevance (e.g., minimum night requirement, recent reviews).
Part 2: Identifying Target Properties

Analyze neighborhoods to identify the most popular ones for vacation rentals (considering number of reviews in the last 12 months).
Clean neighborhood data (standardize capitalization and remove trailing spaces).
Use pivot tables to identify top 10 neighborhoods with most reviews.
Analyze property size (bedrooms) - identify most popular sizes and create a clean "bedrooms_clean" column to handle empty cells.
Use pivot tables to determine optimal property size for each of the top 10 neighborhoods.
Part 3: Calculating Occupancy

Prepare calendar data for occupancy calculations by converting "available" (True/False) to numeric values (0/1) in a new "occupied" column.
Create a "day_of_week" column using the WEEKDAY function and "date" column. (Optional: Use CHOOSE function for more readable weekday labels).
Calculate average occupancy rate per listing using a pivot table with "occupied" column (average provides occupancy percentage).
(Optional) Analyze occupancy rates by day of the week using another pivot table with "day_of_week" and calculate average occupancy for each day. Visualize this data with a bar chart.
Part 4: Estimating Revenue

Filter properties suitable for investment (e.g., Superhosts, high reviews, actively rented, exclude super luxury/low-priced listings).
Choose a top neighborhood and corresponding optimal property size for recommendation.
Use VLOOKUP to add average occupancy rates from Part 3 to the listings sheet.
Create a pivot table to calculate average price and occupancy rate for the chosen neighborhood and property size.
Estimate annual revenue based on average price, occupancy rate, and number of days (365).
Document assumptions made for revenue estimation (e.g., filtering criteria).
Part 5 (Optional): Analyzing Rental Attributes

Investigate correlations between attributes and performance metrics (price, occupancy, review scores).
Analyze if Superhosts charge higher prices, instant booking impacts occupancy, or doorman buildings get better check-in reviews. (This section requires working with the "amenities" text column and potentially creating helper formulas).
Part 6: Documentation and Formatting

Create an Executive Summary sheet with recommendations and a Table of Contents for easy navigation.
Document all data cleaning steps (especially row deletions or Find/Replace usage).
Clearly document any assumptions made during the analysis (e.g., filtering criteria).
Apply formatting for better readability (consistent borders, cell colors, fonts, and hiding unnecessary columns).
